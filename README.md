Rainfall Calculator!

Purpose:
The purpose of the rainfall calculator is to collect information on yearly rainfall patterns, based on monthly precipitation, to get the sum and average of rain precipitation over the selected period of time.

How It Works:
The program first starts by asking how many years the user is looking to include in their calculation. The program will then proceed to ask the user to input the precipitation for each month. A loop is also created to repeatedly ask the user depending on how many years they have input. The program will then display the total amount of rainfall, amount of months calculated, and the average rainfall per month.
